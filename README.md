##VandyApps Professor Application: Demos

Initially/Continually a code base for vandy apps weekly instructional/lecture sessions on asynchronous programming. Currently houses an in-progress professor-chooser app that makes use of Custom RateMyProfessor API and mySQL backend db. This may be expanded over time as instruction continues, or if I think of something else I want to do with it. While a different repo contains a starting skeleton, this contains the fuller version with featureset
